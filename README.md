# Button Chaos 😈

A fun interactive website full of buttons that definitely should not be clicked.

This is a playful experimental project built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to mess with users in harmless ways and demonstrate how much fun simple frontend code can be.

## 🚀 What is this?
Button Chaos is a small web experiment where:
- buttons do unexpected things
- the page reacts to your actions
- curiosity is strongly encouraged (and punished)

It’s intentionally silly, chaotic, and fun.

## 🧠 Why I made this
To learn:
- how websites work using pure code
- JavaScript event handling
- DOM manipulation
- publishing a live website using GitHub Pages

And… because clicking buttons is fun.
